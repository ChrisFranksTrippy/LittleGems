          <h1>Boarding at Little Gems</h1>
          <h3>Your dog will live with us in our home as part of our family. Absolutely NO KENNELS!</h3>
          <p>It is important that your dog knows us and our regular dogs. So ideally we only accept dogs that have at least one day fixed per week at our Day Care. </p>
          <p>If you require boarding and are not a regular, subject to spaces, your dog must have at least one day per week at Day Care - one month prior to their stay with us. This will make sure that your dog is comfortable with us and gets to know our other regular dogs in our Day Care. This will be charged as per day care rates.</p>
          <p>If there are any aggression problems, unfortunately, we will not be able to have them board.</p>
