            <h1>Daycare at Little Gems</h1>
            <p>Doggy Day Care is similar to a childs day care, just drop your dog off, and go to work, knowing that your dog is not bored and lonely. After work, just pick your dog up. </p>
            <p>Your dog will be part of our family for the day, playing and socialising with other friendly socialised dogs. </p>
            <p>We have a safe and enclosed garden area with a sand pit, ball pit, tunnels and plenty of toys to keep your dog occupied. Inside we have various areas, some for chilling and others for more playing. During the day we will also go for a walk to sniff and explore the area! </p>
            <p>Feeding and administring medication is no problem.</p>
            <h3>Perfect for Puppies!</h3>
            <p>Because we only accept friendly socialised dogs, your puppy will learn from the best! They will become part of the pack, and will learn appropriate doggy behaviour from the older dogs. This will teach them respect and doggy manners which a vital in later life. </p>
            <p>Your puppy is never left alone, all play is supervised and puppies will have essential rest periods throughout the day, so they don't overdo it. Also in the puppy day care price, we will undertake toilet training and basic training. </p>
            <p>We accept puppies once they are fully vaccinated.</p>
            <h3>Perfect for older dogs too</h3>
            <p>Most dogs enjoy the daily walk, but if they just want to chill, then that's fine too. There are lots of different areas, from chill out zones to play zones.</p>
            <p>We hope to cater for every dog.</p>
